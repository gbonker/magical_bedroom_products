# Recap

What went well?
I was able to build a fully responsive webpage with the given JSON, HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap), and JavaScript (including jQuery). My solution satisfies all of the given feature stories. Since I used Bootstrap, my solution looks and feels modern and simple. I also added some button animations for when the user adds items to the cart and when the cart is toggled.

What were the snags/gotchas?
I tried playing around with the ES6 setup I was given, but I wasn't able to fully figure out how it worked. As a result, I ended up writing my JavaScript "the old fashioned way" for the most part. I realize that this makes my code less-than-maintainable, so next time I'm going to try to write more jQuery and utilize more JS libraries so that I don't have to write so many lines of code on such a granular level. Nonetheless, the BrowserSync was a nice feature; I'll certainly look into that for future projects. 

What would you improve given/more time resources?
If I had more time and/or resources, I would have loved to expand upon the CSS of my solution, specifically when it comes to visual design. The mockups I was given accurately conveyed the desired interaction design of the application, which I was able to implement with minimal styling with Bootstrap, but I would have loved to play around with the typography and color schemes of the site as well. I would have tried to match Casper's branding as much as possible. I also would have added pictures, but since I was not given pictures as part of the JSON or design docs, I would have probably just put some kind of placeholder image there, which probably wouldn't have looked very good, and would have been implemented in a different way than if every item had an associated image.
Additionally, I also would have spent more time figuring out how to correctly work with the given ES6 environment. Implementing a database to store the JSON in would have also been great so that I don't have to worry about browsers blocking access to it, or so that I don't have to put so much logic inside the $.getJSON function.

If you used a framework, why did you? And what would you have done differently if you hadn't?
I did not use any heavy JavaScript frameworks; I only used vanilla JavaScript and jQuery. If I had used more jQuery, or if I had used a library such as React, I would have tried to write much more concise, manageable JS that more easily kept track of the state of the cart.

Do you have any feedback on the challenge (what would you change, improve, keepâ€¦)?
This was quite a fun challenge to work on. I feel like I definitely learned a lot, and next time I have to implement a cart feature on a site, I know the basic logic behind it (and now have better ideas on how to implement it as well). I would have added a checkout button to the wireframes, since there is usually a checkout button in carts. Other than that, this was very rewarding and I look forward to hearing the team's feedback.
